# Sorting-Visualiser
A visual display of different sorting algorithms using python.
When ran this program generates 50 random values and displays them in a graph format.
The user then picks one of 3 common sorting algorithms, quicksort, mergesort and bubblesort. 
The uses chooses these by pressing either q, m or b respectively.
This then initiates the sorting process, where when each value is being evaluated it 
is highlighted so that the user can follow the algorithm. The speed can be changed within the program too, 
in order to speed up the sequence, or slow it down to allow for learners to really see the processes taking place.
However, slowing it down too much can allow the process to take to long to the point where the sorting will take too long.
